# font

This directory contains the fonts used by the example programs, together with
a reference copy of the 8x8 PC Engine System Card font.

The ".dat" files are binary 1-bit-per-pixel versions of the fonts, suitable
for including in a PCEAS project with "incbin".

The ".fon" files are editable versions of the fonts, suitable for Windows and
Linux font-editor programs.

Personally, I recommend using a program called "Fony" on Windows (and Linux).

Fony
===========================================================================

What is Fony?
-------------
 Fony is an editor for bitmap (raster) fonts. While the focus is on
 Windows FNT/FON bitmap fonts, it can import and export some other
 popular file formats.


How much does it cost?
----------------------
 Nothing, although I accept and appreciate donations via PayPal.
 Especially if you're using Fony for commercial efforts.
